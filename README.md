# JAuswertung

JAuswertung is a program for conducting and recording competitions. 
It doesn't matter whether you want to hold championships or friendly competitions. 
You are not bound to predetermined disciplines and can simply define new age groups, disciplines, 
rule violations, etc. You also don't have to worry about the division of the races 
(both for the swimming part and for the additional scoring). 
JAuswertung can create a run division according to your wishes. 
If you want to adjust these later, JAuswertung will also support you.

Central attention was paid to ease of use and high input speed. 
For example, if you discover an error in the results, you can change it there directly, 
regardless of whether it is an incorrect time, an incorrectly entered rule violation 
or a misspelled name. Continuous time entry allows you to enter times directly 
as they arrive at you. This entry method is so efficient that you would have 
no problem evaluating multiple competitions at the same time.

Registrations are usually managed in a spreadsheet until they are transferred to an evaluation program. 
JAuswertung also supports you with this. If the data is available as an Excel or CSV file, 
it can be imported directly. In many competitions, an overall victory is awarded to the most successful division. 
You also don't have to calculate an overall rating by hand. Simply activate the overall rating 
and set it to your liking.

In addition, JAuswertung can check the data entered and detect many errors such as missing times 
or missing entries in the running list for participants who were added later. 
So instead of having to check the correctness of your data in different places, 
you can query this information in one place and correct it directly if it makes sense. 
Furthermore, JAuswertung can also check whether the data entered is plausible and thus inform you, 
for example, of very low or high times.
